# Pool Maintenance System Component Library

Welcome to the Pool Maintenance System component library. This Storybook documents all UI components used in our community pool maintenance and scheduling management application.

## üèä About This Project

The Pool Maintenance System is designed to help communities manage their pool facilities efficiently by providing:

- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Schedule regular maintenance tasks and track completion
- **Chemical Management**: Monitor and manage pool chemical levels for safety compliance
- **Technician Management**: Assign and track technician availability and certifications
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live chemical readings and pool status updates
- **Safety Compliance**: Ensure adherence to MAHC (Model Aquatic Health Code) guidelines
- **Multi-role Access**: Support for pool managers, technicians, and administrators
- **Emergency Response**: Critical alert system for immediate safety concerns

### Key Features

- üß™ **Chemical Testing**: Automated chlorine, pH, and alkalinity monitoring
- üìä **Dashboard Analytics**: Visual representations of pool health and maintenance metrics
- üîß **Task Management**: Priority-based assignment and tracking system
- üì± **Mobile Ready**: Responsive design for technicians working on-site
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety Alerts**: Instant notifications for chemical imbalances or equipment failures

## üé® Design System

Our design system is built on these principles:

### Colors

- **Primary**: Sky blue (#0ea5e9) - represents water and cleanliness
- **Secondary**: Emerald (#10b981) - indicates healthy/safe conditions
- **Warning**: Amber (#f59e0b) - for caution states
- **Danger**: Red (#ef4444) - for alerts and critical issues

### Component Architecture

We follow Atomic Design principles with pool maintenance-specific patterns:

- **Atoms**: Basic UI elements
  - [Button](/docs/components-atoms-button--docs) - Action triggers with pool-specific variants
  - [Input](/docs/components-atoms-input--docs) - Form inputs with validation for chemical readings
  - [Badge](/docs/components-atoms-badge--docs) - Status indicators for pool conditions and alerts
  - [Select](/docs/components-atoms-select--docs) - Dropdowns for technician, pool, and chemical selection

- **Molecules**: Composed component groups
  - [Card](/docs/components-molecules-card--docs) - Information containers for pools, tasks, and readings
  - [Form Patterns](/docs/components-molecules-form-patterns--docs) - MAHC-compliant validation patterns

- **Organisms**: Complex pool maintenance components
  - Dashboard layouts with real-time data
  - Chemical reading forms with cross-field validation
  - Technician assignment interfaces

### Component Categories

Our Storybook is organized into these main categories:

1. **Atoms** - Fundamental building blocks
2. **Molecules** - Composite components
3. **Organisms** - Complex interface sections
4. **Templates** - Page-level layouts
5. **Pages** - Complete user workflows

```

## üìö How to Use This Storybook

### Navigation

- Use the sidebar to browse components by category (Atoms ‚Üí Molecules ‚Üí Organisms)
- Each component has multiple stories showing different states and pool maintenance scenarios
- Use the controls panel to interact with component props in real-time
- Toggle between light/dark/pool themes using the toolbar
- Search components using the search bar (‚åò+K or Ctrl+K)

### Pool Maintenance Examples

Each component includes realistic pool maintenance scenarios:

- **Select Component**: Technician assignment, pool selection, chemical type selection
- **Card Component**: Pool status dashboards, chemical readings with trends, maintenance tasks
- **Form Patterns**: MAHC-compliant chemical reading forms with validation
- **Input Component**: Chemical value inputs with range validation
- **Badge Component**: Status indicators for pool conditions and technician availability

### Component Documentation

Each component story includes:

- **Overview**: Component purpose and pool maintenance usage
- **Props**: Interactive controls to modify component behavior
- **Code**: Copy-ready code snippets with TypeScript types
