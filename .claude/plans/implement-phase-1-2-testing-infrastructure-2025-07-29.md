## PRP Specification

### Goal

- **Primary Objective**: Establish comprehensive testing infrastructure for the pool maintenance system including unit testing with Vitest, E2E testing with Playwright, API mocking with MSW, and CI/CD pipeline setup
- **Success Definition**: All testing frameworks operational, sample tests passing, CI/CD pipeline executing on commits
- **User Value**: Ensures code quality, prevents regressions, enables confident development and deployment

### Context

- **Technical Environment**:
  - React 19 + TypeScript (strict mode)
  - Vite 7.0.4 build tool
  - Bun package manager
  - Existing shadcn/ui components
  - Development server on port 5173
- **File Locations**:
  - Project root: `/home/sam/code/pool_maintainer`
  - Source code: `src/`
  - Tests will be in: `src/__tests__/`, `tests/e2e/`
- **Related Systems**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **Constraints**: Must maintain fast test execution times, support both development and CI environments

### Success Criteria

- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Vitest executes unit and integration tests
  - Playwright runs E2E tests across browsers
  - MSW intercepts and mocks API calls
  - CI/CD pipeline runs all tests on commits
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:

  - E2E tests complete in <5 minutes
  - 100% type safety in test files
  - Zero flaky tests
- **Quality Gates**:
  - All tests pass before merge
  - Code coverage reports generated
  - Test artifacts stored in CI
- **Validation Steps**:
  - Sample unit test for Button component passes
  - Sample E2E test for homepage loads
  - MSW successfully mocks an API endpoint
  - GitHub Actions workflow triggers on push

### Implementation Blueprint

#### Architecture Overview

1. **Testing Pyramid**:
   - Unit Tests: Vitest + React Testing Library (70%)
   - Integration Tests: Vitest + MSW (20%)
   - E2E Tests: Playwright (10%)

2. **Mock Strategy**:
   - MSW for API mocking across all environments
   - Shared handlers between tests and development
   - Type-safe mock responses

3. **CI/CD Architecture**:
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Parallel test execution
   - Artifact storage for test results

#### Step-by-Step Plan

**Phase A: Vitest Setup (Unit & Integration Testing)**

1. Install Vitest and React Testing Library dependencies
2. Configure vitest.config.ts with React and TypeScript support
3. Set up test utilities and custom render functions
4. Create sample unit test for Button component
5. Configure code coverage reporting

**Phase B: MSW Setup (API Mocking)**

1. Install MSW and configure for browser/node environments
2. Create mock handlers directory structure
3. Set up MSW initialization for development
4. Create type-safe mock handlers
5. Integrate MSW with Vitest for testing

**Phase C: Playwright Setup (E2E Testing)**

1. Install Playwright with TypeScript support
2. Configure playwright.config.ts for Vite integration
3. Set up Page Object Model structure
4. Create sample E2E test for homepage
5. Configure visual regression testing

**Phase D: CI/CD Pipeline Setup**

1. Create GitHub Actions workflow file
2. Configure test job with dependency caching
3. Set up parallel test execution
4. Configure test result reporting
5. Add branch protection rules

#### File Modifications

- Create: `vitest.config.ts`
- Create: `src/test-utils.tsx`
- Create: `src/__tests__/components/Button.test.tsx`
- Create: `src/mocks/handlers.ts`
- Create: `src/mocks/browser.ts`
- Create: `src/mocks/server.ts`
- Create: `playwright.config.ts`
- Create: `tests/e2e/homepage.spec.ts`
- Create: `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- Modify: `package.json` (add test scripts)
- Modify: `src/main.tsx` (MSW initialization)

#### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions with mocked APIs
3. **E2E Tests**: Test critical user journeys
4. **Visual Regression**: Capture UI changes
5. **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure WCAG compliance

#### Risk Mitigation

- **MSW Service Worker conflicts**: Use conditional initialization
- **Playwright flakiness**: Implement proper wait strategies
- **CI resource usage**: Use dependency caching
- **Type safety**: Generate types from OpenAPI specs

### Validation Loops

#### Development Testing

- Run `bun test` for unit tests
- Run `bun test:e2e` for E2E tests
- Verify MSW mocks in browser DevTools
- Check coverage reports

#### Integration Testing

- Push to feature branch triggers CI
- All tests must pass
- Coverage thresholds enforced
- Performance metrics tracked

#### Performance Testing

- Unit test execution time <10s
- E2E test execution time <5min
- Bundle size impact minimal

#### User Acceptance

- Developers can write tests easily
- CI provides clear feedback
- Test failures are actionable
- Mock data is realistic

## Implementation Tasks

### Task Breakdown

1. **Vitest & React Testing Library Setup** (2 hours)

   - Configure Vitest
   - Create test utilities
   - Write sample tests

2. **MSW Configuration** (2 hours)
   - Install and configure MSW
   - Create handler structure
   - Set up development integration
   - Create sample mocks

3. **Playwright Setup** (2 hours)

5. **Documentation & Integration** (1 hour)
   - Update README with test commands
   - Create testing guidelines
   - Integrate with existing tools
   - Verify all systems work together

### Dependencies

- Phase A must complete before Phase B (MSW needs test environment)

- Phase D requires A, B, C to be complete

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

1. **MSW Service Worker Registration** (Medium)
   - Mitigation: Conditional initialization, clear error handling
2. **Playwright Browser Downloads** (Low)
   - Mitigation: Use npx playwright install-deps

3. **CI Resource Limits** (Medium)
   - Mitigation: Optimize with caching, parallel execution

### Timeline Risks

1. **Complex Configuration** (Medium)
   - Mitigation: Use proven configuration templates

2. **Learning Curve** (Low)
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive examples and documentation

### Quality Risks

1. **Flaky Tests** (Medium)
   - Mitigation: Proper wait strategies, retry logic

2. **Incomplete Coverage** (Low)
   - Mitigation: Coverage thresholds, regular reviews

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Vitest runs with `bun test` command
- [ ] Sample unit test passes for Button component
- [ ] MSW mocks API calls in development
- [ ] Playwright runs E2E tests successfully
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow executes on push
- [ ] All TypeScript types are satisfied
- [ ] Coverage reports are generated
- [ ] Documentation is complete

## Notes

- Use Vitest instead of Jest for better Vite integration
- MSW v2 syntax is significantly different from v1
- Playwright component testing is experimental, stick to E2E
- Consider Vitest browser mode for future component testing
- Bun compatibility should be verified for all tools
