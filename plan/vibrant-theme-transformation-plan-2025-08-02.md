# Vibrant Dynamic Theme Transformation Plan

**Created**: 2025-08-02  
**Type**: Technical Implementation Plan  

## Goal
Transform the existing OKLCH-based theme system into a vibrant, modern dynamic theme with multiple mood-based variants, gradients, glassmorphism effects, and micro-interactions while maintaining WCAG AA accessibility compliance.

## Technical Context
- **Current State**: Basic light/dark theme system with OKLCH color foundation, three-layer CSS architecture (base → semantic → component tokens), theme provider with localStorage persistence
- **Architecture**: React/TypeScript with advanced theme provider supporting contrast/motion preferences, CVA button variants, existing color scales for pool-specific semantics
- **Constraints**: Must maintain accessibility standards, pool maintenance domain context, existing component architecture
- **Dependencies**: Existing OKLCH color system, theme-provider context, CSS custom properties architecture

3. **Border and shadow enhancement**
   - Implement subtle border gradients with CSS border-image
   - Add multi-layer shadow system for depth perception
   - Create glow effects for interactive elements
   - Optimize shadow rendering with CSS contain

### Milestone 4: Micro-Interactions and Animation System
**Success Criteria**: Smooth hover/focus animations implemented with reduced motion support
**Dependencies**: Milestone 3 completion, animation performance benchmarks
**Verification**: All animations <300ms duration, respect prefers-reduced-motion, 60fps performance

**Tasks**:
1. **Enhanced hover and focus states**
   - Add scale/glow transformations to interactive elements
   - Implement color-shifting effects on hover
   - Create ripple effects for button interactions
   - Add smooth elevation changes with shadows

2. **Theme transition animations**
   - Implement cross-fade animations between theme modes
